# Commands:

# Everyone can use:
#     !HELP    -    A student needs help and is added to the queue.
#     !SHOWQUEUE    -    Show everyone standing in line.
#     !KNIGHT    -     The Black Knight will cite random quotes from
#     Monty Python The Holy Grail.
#     !LEAVE    -    If you no longer wish to stand in line,
#     you can leave the queue.
#
# Teachers assistants can slao use:
#     !NEXT    -    I'm done helping a student and can start helping
#     the next one. (removes the next student from the queue).
#     Do this before each Teachers assistants class:
#     !CLEARCHAT    -    Removes all messages in the chat.
#     !CLEARQUEUE    -    Removes all students in the queue.
#
# The program reads and writes to the csv file help_queue.csv so that the data is not lost if the bot crashes.
