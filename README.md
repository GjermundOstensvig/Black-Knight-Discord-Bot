# Black-Knight-Discord-Bot
Helpful Discord bot for tutoring hours with TAs.
The bot controls a queue of students that needs help with school work.

The Discord Bot needs Python 3.7 to work. At the time I wrote this bot, the Discord module did not work with newer versions of Python.

Use the requirements.txt file to install the required packages:
pip install -r requirements.txt

To use this bot, add the Token, Guild name, and TA usernames (example in code).
